# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Creopse** documentation! This guide will help you get started with Creopse, a hybrid Content Management System (CMS) built on Laravel 10. Follow the steps below to quickly set up and begin using Creopse.

## Requirements

Before installing Creopse, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- Laravel 10
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- pnpm

## Installation

### 1. Install Laravel

To start, create a fresh Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel:^10.0 project-name
```

Replace `project-name` with the desired name for your project directory.

### 2. Add Creopse to Your Project

This will add Creopse to your Laravel project.

### 3. Install Creopse Files

Run the following Artisan command to publish the necessary configuration files and resources:
